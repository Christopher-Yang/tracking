To plot phasors for stroke patients, download the following files:

1. main.m
2. load_data.m
3. analyze_data.m
4. fourier.m
5. error_unwrap.m
6. (I think that's it but there may be other files as well)

Run the first section of main.m to load and analyze the data. Then run the second section of main.m (graph_phasor.m) to plot the phasors for individual subjects. Change the value in "subj" to switch between subj1-4.
